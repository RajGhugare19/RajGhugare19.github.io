        I am currently working as a research intern at MILA, advised by <a href="https://www.fracturedplane.com/">Glen Berseth</a>. During my undergraduate, I worked on model-based RL, advised by <a href="https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/">Ben Eysenbach</a>. 
        I studied electronics and communications engineering from VNIT Nagpur.

        My research studies reinforcement learning in general, aiming at building autonomous agents that learn a model of their environment to exhibit behaviors that are useful. 
        My main research interests in reinforcement learning are model-based RL, hierarchical RL, representation and abstractions in RL. The developments in specialised topics like unsupervised RL, continual RL and generalisation in RL, also interest me. I am happy to work on these specialisations in the context of supervised learning as well.
